<h2 id="top" class="italic"> "A famous quote by Sylvester Stallone in Rocky" </h2>

<p >“Let me tell you something you already know. <span class="big"> <u> The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. </u> </span></p>

<p > It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are. </p>

<p > <span class="big"> <u> It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. </u> </span></p>

<p > You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. </p>

<p> <span class="big"> <u> It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. </u> </span></p>

<p >How much you can take and keep moving forward.<span class="big"> <u> That's how winning is done!” </u> </span></p>
