<h2 id="top" class="italic"> A famous quote by Sylvester Stallone in Rocky </h2>

<p >“Let me tell you something you already know. <span class="italic underline"> The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. </span></p>

<p > <span class="italic underline">It's a very mean and nasty place </span>and I don't care how tough you are. </p>

<p > <span class="italic underline"> It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it.</span></p>

<p > You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.<span class="italic underline"> But it ain't about how hard ya hit.</span> </p>

<p> <span class="italic underline"> It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. </span></p>

<p >How much you can take and keep moving forward.<span class="italic underline"> That's how winning is done!” </span></p>
